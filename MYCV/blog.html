            <h2>Q1. Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element
                isresponsive ? why ?</h2>

            <p>Earlier versions of today’s browsers had limited features, and we had to consider how to work with — or
                around— those when designing and developing our sites. Static and adaptive layouts were commonplace, and
                our sites were designed to pixel perfection. </p> <br>

            <p> There are a couple of reasons to use unitless scales. Of course we can set everything in pixels, but if
                we
                want to make something responsive, we usually need to overwrite more values. And another, maybe more
                important, reason: some people will have their browser font size set to something else than the default
                16px, for example people who are visually impaired. </p><br>

            <p> The other reason for using responsive and unitless values in our CSS is for supporting our
                users that rely on zooming. Our users need to be
                able to zoom the viewport without loss of content or functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS
                values or viewport scaling settings.
                Zooming allowed us users to zoom everything on the page by
                scaling up and down proportionally depending on our preferences. But as browsers handle page zoom for
                us,
                there is a difference in how the the UI appears when the page is zoomed depending on the weather the
                default
                browser size has been adjested as well. </p><br>


            <p> Relative css units and unitless
                values like (%,em, rem) are used in our css to meet the needs of ever-changing viewport sizes.
                Since giving units in this way will enables us to zoom the viewport without loss of the content and
                resize text without
                being forced to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read the content. </p><br>


            <p> Hence, I prefer to use rem for font-sizes, em for margins and paddings and px for borders. I still use
                pixels
                when it comes to borders, because I usually want a border to be just a fine, 1px line.
                By using em for margins and paddings, they will increase when you increase the font size of your
                element: perfect responsiveness. Most times, a font size on a smartphone can be smaller than on a larger
                display. If you set a higher root size for the latter, everything will scale proportionally.</p> <br>




            <h2>Q2. 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser
                interprets
                that ? </h2>
